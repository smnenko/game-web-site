These weapons - including lasers, water bombs, grenades, and rockets - can be picked up along the way, and MT-ED can switch between them with ease. If MT-ED comes into contact with any of the creatures, he is kicked into the air and gets stunned for a few seconds. If this happens, he loses one of his lives. Not all creatures are deadly; some of them will steal whatever weapons MT-ED is carrying at the time. \n \nBesides using weapons to kill, MT-ED also has the ability to jump over creatures that may be too slow for him to shoot. When MT-ED finally rescues Hercules, a sub-game needs to be completed.

It is fundamentally different from most solitaire games in that nearly all deals can be solved. Although software implementations vary, most versions label the hands with a number (derived from the random number seed used to generate the hand).\n\nRules\n\nConstruction and layout:\n\n* One standard 52-card deck is used.\n* There are four open cells and four open foundations. Some alternate rules use between one to ten cells.\n* Cards are dealt into eight cascades, four of which comprise seven cards and four of which comprise six. Some alternate rules will use between four to ten cascades.\n\nBuilding during play:\n\n* The top card of each cascade begins a tableau.\n* Tableaux must be built down by alternating colors.\n* Foundations are built up by suit.\n\nMoves:\n\n* Any cell card or top card of any cascade may be moved to build on a tableau, or moved to an empty cell, an empty cascade, or its foundation.\n* Complete or partial tableaus may be moved to build on existing tableaus, or moved to empty cascades, by recursively placing and removing cards through intermediate locations. While computer implementations often show this motion, players using physical decks typically move the tableau at once.\n\nVictory:\n\n* The game is won after all cards are moved to their foundation piles.\n\nFor games with the standard layout (four open cells and eight cascades) most games are easily solved.\n\nSupported Operations:\n* Tap one column and tap another column, move the cards from the first column to second column if possible;\n* Double Tap on the column's last card to move it to buffer area, if possible;\n* Drag cards from one column to another column, if possible;\n* Auto throw, cards will be throw to recycle automatically, if possible;\n* Drag from recycle to columns to restore the recycled card, if possible;\n\nWith Auto-throw, it is much more convenient to finish the card puzzle!\nEnjoy it, players!", "genres": "", "platforms": "Mac", "date_release": "July 2011", "screenshots": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/an0ifaz9gbknfyhfezym.jpg://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ljbx2rtlyqusncdo45vp.jpg://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iicfa5mjs5anzu8f76ka.jpg://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wrlzcqg5tnnvle6qonfe.jpg://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bqfvpjb4opu7qd8k0adq.jpg", "ratings_users": "70.0", "ratings_users_count": "0", "ratings_critics": "", "ratings_critics_count": ""}}, {"model": "games.game", "pk": 87237, "fields": {"date_created": "2021-05-27T06:30:20.834Z", "name": "PapiBatting", "short_description": "", "logo": "https://www.tryngo.ch/img/no-img.jpg", "description": "", "genres": "", "platforms": "", "date_release": "", "screenshots": "", "ratings_users": "80.0", "ratings_users_count": "0", "ratings_critics": "", "ratings_critics_count": ""}}, {"model": "games.game", "pk": 87677, "fields": {"date_created": "2021-05-27T06:30:10.633Z", "name": "Pop-up Pilgrams", "short_description": "", "logo": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co241p.jpg", "description": "", "genres": "", "platforms": "PlayStation Vita:PlayStation VR", "date_release": "February 2018", "screenshots": "", "ratings_users": "", "ratings_users_count": "", "ratings_critics": "", "ratings_critics_count": ""}}, {"model": "games.game", "pk": 87751, "fields": {"date_created": "2021-05-27T06:30:09.240Z", "name": "Counter-Strike Avalon", "short_description": "", "logo": "https://www.tryngo.ch/img/no-img.jpg", "description": "He is a good game", "genres": "Shooter", "platforms": "PlayStation 2", "date_release": "February 2007", "screenshots": "", "ratings_users": "", "ratings_users_count": "", "ratings_critics": "", "ratings_critics_count": ""}}, {"model": "games.game", "pk": 87942, "fields": {"date_created": "2021-05-27T06:30:34.927Z", "name": "Jesters Poker", "short_description": "", "logo": "https://www.tryngo.ch/img/no-img.jpg", "description": "The best single player Poker adventure out now!", "genres": "Adventure", "platforms": "", "date_release": "", "screenshots": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cslrnzjurespl0fks3as.jpg://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/c4hxq1eicsmux5d0tbjj.jpg://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hh6hukno9xsqyqztl3wc.jpg://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/y7oykwqcszvbin2lrdqx.jpg://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pzvnvolnydozl3crci53.jpg", "ratings_users": "", "ratings_users_count": "", "ratings_critics": "", "ratings_critics_count": ""}}, {"model": "games.game", "pk": 88217, "fields": {"date_created": "2021-05-27T06:30:11.858Z", "name": "Duck Bow Hunt", "short_description": "", "logo": "https://www.tryngo.ch/img/no-img.jpg", "description": "", "genres": "", "platforms": "", "date_release": "", "screenshots": "", "ratings_users": "", "ratings_users_count": "", "ratings_critics": "", "ratings_critics_count": ""}}, {"model": "games.game", "pk": 88448, "fields": {"date_created": "2021-05-27T06:30:34.900Z", "name": "Topple Drop", "short_description": "", "logo": "https://www.tryngo.ch/img/no-img.jpg", "description": "", "genres": "", "platforms": "", "date_release": "", "screenshots": "", "ratings_users": "", "ratings_users_count": "", "ratings_critics": "", "ratings_critics_count": ""}}, {"model": "games.game", "pk": 88741, "fields": {"date_created": "2021-05-27T06:30:12.168Z", "name": "Anime Dress Up", "short_description": "", "logo": "https://www.tryngo.ch/img/no-img.jpg", "description": "Create your own anime character by dressing and styling her.

It was also ported to the Acorn Electron. A platform game with some puzzle solving elements. Michael Jakobsen’s puzzle-platformer, centred around a castle, requires players to find five hidden crystals and return them to their rightful place. Outside of the castle there are outside areas (including a wasteland, a pyramid, a sea and an island). \n \nUpon returning the crystals, the player must teleport to a separate set of locations to complete the game. Once the game is completed, the player is left free to roam the castle in order to achieve the maximum possible score if they have not done so already. The only way to see the final congratulatory message is to reach 99 points. \n \nCitadel was unusual at the time for playing synthesized speech before loading the main game (in part to advertise Superior Software's \"Speech!\" programme package), as well as having other special effects advanced for the time, such as splashing water sounds. Many BBC Micro gamers regard Citadel as a seminal game and it has spawned social media appreciation pages.", "genres": "Platform:Adventure", "platforms": "BBC Microcomputer System:Acorn Electron", "date_release": "December 1985", "screenshots": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc81yc.jpg", "ratings_users": "", "ratings_users_count": "", "ratings_critics": "", "ratings_critics_count": ""}}, {"model": "games.game", "pk": 132056, "fields": {"date_created": "2021-05-27T06:30:16.382Z", "name": "Robot Battle", "short_description": "", "logo": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co22uo.jpg", "description": "A game about battles of funny robots.
